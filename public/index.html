<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/">Marketplace</a>, but I was terribly disappointed by <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/02/29/leveraging_face_time_at_an_unconference">today&#8217;s report about unconferences</a>.</p>
<p>Your report entirely missed the point of *why* people have unconferences in the first place&#8230; to share their passions with other, like-minded people in an open forum.</p>
<p><a href="http://edward.oconnor.cx/">Along</a> <a href="http://www.lisabrewster.com">with</a> <a href="http://aisleten.com">several</a> <a href="http://www.thaumatocracy.com">friends</a>, I&#8217;ve organized <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampSanDiego">BarCamp San Diego</a>&#8230; which is an unconference that has broad support among San Diego tech community (with sponsors like Microsoft, Opera, DivX, Stage 6, etc.)</p>
<p>Our BarCamps have featured talks on topics like yoga, knitting, how to screenprint your own t-shirts, and the San Diego fires; not to mention many great technical talks (on topics from web design to video games.)</p>
<p>At the two BarCamps we&#8217;ve hosted thus far, the attendees spanned a broad demographic, from college students to professionals. None of them were like the goofy nerds you portrayed in your piece.</p>
<p>Oh, and&#8230; we had working wifi too.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Perhaps you can do a follow up story about BarCamp? <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp</a> is a global unconference movement&#8230; and it&#8217;s spawned tons of related conferences such as the one your reporter visited.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Patrick Crowley</p>

<p>This weekend will mark the first BarCamp conference in San Diego. With over 70 speakers already signed up, it&#8217;s looking to be a blast.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never organized a conference before, but I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun putting this together.</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/01/18/ive-cut-the-cable-cord/" rel="bookmark">I&#8217;ve cut the cable cord</a></h1>

<p class="date">January 18, 2007 <span class="comments_link"><a href="/2007/01/18/ive-cut-the-cable-cord/#comments" class="feedback" title="Comment on I've cut the cable cord">24 comments</a></span></p>
	
<p><img src="http://mokolabs.com/images/blog/cable_cord.jpg" width="560" height="369" alt="I've cut the cable cord" /></p>
<p>On Monday, I disconnected my cable service.</p>
<p>While the cable-box-is-your-DVR paradigm has served me well over the past five years, it just seems a bit silly now. I&#8217;m paying a pretty high premium for time-shifting (either in the near term: to pause live television, or in the long term: to record shows I&#8217;d like to watch later.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the math for a second.</p>
<h2>Cable is expensive</h2>
<p>My cable bill is $130/month. That breaks down to $70 month for the cheapest digital cable/DVR combo, and another $60 for the high speed internet connection.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to ditch the internet connection. But all the other options suck. Dialup: are you fucking kidding me? DSL: too slow. Verizon FiOS: not available in San Diego yet.</p>
<p>Ok, so I&#8217;m stuck with internet. What about cable? How much am I spending per year? Well, math fans, $70 x 12 is $840. Ouch. I have to say this number was a bit shocking. Does cable really provide <em>that</em> much value to my life?</p>
<p>My high school economics professor used to always talk about opportunity cost (i.e. if you spent money on something else, what would it buy?)</p>
<p>So what could I buy with an extra $840 in my pocket?</p>
<ul>
<li>42 DVDs (at $20 per DVD)</li>
<li>120 paperback books (at $7 per book)</li>
<li>420 television episodes from iTunes (at $2 per show)</li>
<li>840 songs from iTunes (at $1 per track)</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting to make sense? Yeah? So let&#8217;s keep going!</p>
<p>The point of this exercise &#8212; the reason I cut the cord &#8212; is that I want to <em>save</em> money, so the more of that $840 I can keep, the better.</p>
<h2>iTunes is now a real alternative</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I figured out. I watch 5 shows regularly. You know, the ones I can&#8217;t miss. They areâ€¦ LOST, Battlestar Galactica, Studio 60, Heroes, and Dr. Who.</p>
<p>With the &#8220;season pass&#8221; feature from iTunes, I can subscribe to an entire season of episodes from a show for approximately $35. Too, they&#8217;re widescreen, near HD quality, and commercial free. (Another plus: if I&#8217;m traveling, I can take my shows with me or download them on the road.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have one of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">AppleTV units</a>, but that&#8217;s ok. My office is also my living room, and I&#8217;ve got a clear view of my 23in Cinema Display from the couch.</p>
<p>Now, of course, nothing is perfect. For me, the main drawbacks to this plan are not being able to watch live television or content that isn&#8217;t available on iTunes yet. But I can live with that.</p>
<p>So, five shows at $35 per season. That&#8217;s $175. I&#8217;d save $665 a year.</p>
<p>Not bad. But can we do better?</p>
<h2>And it&#8217;s really cheap</h2>
<p>I typically watch LOST and BSG with friends, so I probably don&#8217;t need a season pass for these. But I&#8217;ll probably still want to buy my favorite episodes, so let&#8217;s say that works out to $10 per show.</p>
<p>And it turns out Dr. Who isn&#8217;t available on iTunes yet (cheeky Brits!), so I&#8217;ll have to watch that with friends or maybe grab a torrent.</p>
<p>That cuts down the cost quite a bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>BSG: $10</li>
<li>LOST: $10</li>
<li>Heroes: $42</li>
<li>Studio 60: $35</li>
<li>Dr Who: ~</li>
</ul>
<p>Total cost: $97. (About $743 less than I had planned to pay.)</p>
<h2>The future is unbundled</h2>
<p>A year of television for under 100 bucks. Not only is that it&#8217;s an awesome price, it really makes the business model of companies like TiVo seem tenuous.</p>
<p>DVR was magic five years ago, but we&#8217;re living in the future now.

<p class="date">November 14, 2006 <span class="comments_link"><a href="/2006/11/14/amazon-rips-off-eventful-logo/#comments" class="feedback" title="Comment on Amazon rips off Eventful logo?">10 comments</a></span></p>
	
<p><img src="/images/blog/askville.gif" width="560" height="284" alt="Logo comparison" /></p>
<p>During my last full-time gig, I designed the <a href="http://eventful.com">Eventful</a> logo.</p>
<p>So, I was amused to see that Amazon &#8220;borrowed&#8221; my design for <a href="http://askville.amazon.com">Askville</a>, their new question and answer service that intends to compete with Google Answers.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s similar?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arial Rounded MT Bold? Check.</li>
<li>Tighter font-spacing? Check.</li>
<li>Lowercase type? Check.</li>
<li>Use logo on plain-white background? Check.</li>
<li>Switch colors for each morpheme? Check.</li>
<li>Use only two colors? Check.</li>
<li>Blue on left? Check.</li>
<li>Green on right? Check.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s different?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eventful logo uses more compact letterforms (86% of normal width).</li>
<li>Eventful uses a brighter blue and darker green than Askville.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is Web 2.0 running out of logo gas?</strong></p>
<p>I freely admit my design wasn&#8217;t the world&#8217;s most original logo. And a year plus later, it&#8217;s hard to remember my exact influences, but I certainly was inspired by Flickr, MySpace, SimplyHired, and Apple&#8217;s penchant for tweaked-out versions of public fonts.</p>
<p>Now, of course, great design is always influenced by <em>that which came before</em>, but the Eventful logo is fairly well known. It pops up on all <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/stabilo-boss/93136022/">Web 2.0 logo</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/stabilo-boss/101793493/">lists</a> and was featured in Font Shop&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/web-20-logos.cfm">Web 2.0 logo roundup</a> as an example of &#8220;the softies&#8221; (described as text-heavy logos with a human feel).</p>
<p>Sure, the similarity is probably is just a coindence. But I&#8217;m surprised to see a company of Amazon&#8217;s caliber making this sort of mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>So, if anyone from Amazon is listening, I suggest creating a more compelling brand for Askville, regardless of the logo similarities. But, hey, no hard feelings&#8230; you&#8217;re still my number one.</p>
<p>Congrats, btw, to Jeff Bezos on today&#8217;s Blue Origin rocket launch!</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>(Oddly enough, Amazon isn&#8217;t the first. <a href="http://podcastready.com">PodcastReady.com</a> has a similar logo, though they used a slightly different typeface and added an earbud-inspired mark.)

<p>Whoa&#8230;. looks like the New York Post just launched a redesign. Sneaky bastards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/nypost1.jpg" width="560" height="367" alt="New York Post" /></p>
<p>If you ever used the old Post site, then you know how much of a miracle this really is. It was a big stinking pile of crap. Blinking font tags, insane numbers of banner tags (sometimes, they&#8217;d even prevent pages from loading fully), and a tacky design that smelled like 1996.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/nypost2.jpg" width="560" height="375" alt="Google maps" /></p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my favorite new feature. The <a href="http://www.nypost.com/gossip/sightings/sightings.htm">Page Six Star Map</a>. It&#8217;s got Google Maps integration so now you can see exactly where your favorite celebrities were spotted. Our first victims&hellip; I mean celebrities: Bill and Melinda Gates!</p>
<p><strong>What I like</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Layout optimized for 1024 x 768</li>
<li>Improved branding &mdash; the website design is now almost identical to the print version of the paper. Big fonts and images. They even add faux scuff marks on the edges of the layout. I love it.</li>
<li>Better ad placement &mdash; advertisements are now tastefully presented and no longer overwhelm site content</li>
<li>The site isn&#8217;t valid HTML 4.01 yet, but the markup is reasonably well-formed. Believe it or not, the Post (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com">126 errors</a>) is more valid than the New York Times (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnytimes.com">479 errors</a>). Do conservatives write better markup?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I don&#8217;t like</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>News articles are broken into &#8220;pages&#8221;. Can you say &#8220;we need more pageviews&#8221;?</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.nypost.com/css/style.css">main stylesheet</a> is bloated with lots of repetitive declarations</li>
<li>Some of the Flash content has classic bad UI design, like tiny unmarked paginators. (Are next and previous buttons really so bad?)</li>
<li>Do we really need a weather bug in the header? Cute, but unnecessary. Removing it would let the other elements in the header breathe a bit.</li>
<li>The search &#8220;Go&#8221; button in the site header is too small and illegible.</li>
<li>The Opinion section could use a more contextualized layout, with more prominent placement of editorial headlines and bylines</li>
<li>The Post is still a shill for the Bush administration</li>
</ul>
<p>Final word: it&#8217;s not quite as good as the new <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">Vinh Khoi powered</a> New York Times, but this is a solid redesign.

<p>In the spirit of the <a href="http://www.theargonexpress.com">Argon Express</a>, I&#8217;m taking the train to this year&#8217;s RubyConf.</p>
<p>I know a couple of other <a href="http://sdruby.com">sd.rb</a> people are going, so if you live near L.A. or one of the other stops on the route, hop on board!</p>
<p><strong>WHEN:</strong><br />
October 18 - October 19.</p>
<p>Total trip time is about 1.5 days. We&#8217;re leaving from San Diego at 3pm. If you&#8217;re leaving from Los Angeles, you want to catch the 6:45pm Southwest Chief. We&#8217;ll arrive in Denver around 10:25pm the next day.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong><br />
The <a href="http://www.trainweb.com/routes/route_03/rg_3old.htm">Southwest Chief</a> on Amtrak, heading from Los Angeles to Denver.</p>
<p><strong>COST:</strong><br />
Using Amtrak discount code &#8216;H571&#8242;, one-way tickets from LA to Denver are $80. And roundtrip tickets are $160. (Airfare runs about $250 - $400, so this is a sweet bargain.)</p>
<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Hack out with other Rubyists before the main conference. (I&#8217;m planning to build a new Rails app from scratch during the trip.)</p>
<p>&bull; Stay online with EVDO-enabled WIFI (where coverage allows)</p>
<p>&bull; Check out the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sheilaellen/sets/72057594082257788/">scenery</a> from the observation car</p>

<p><strong>RIDERS:</strong></p>

&bull; <a href="http://zadrozny.com/nick">Nick Zadrozny</a><br />
&bull; <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark</a></p>
<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Are you taking rail the whole way?</strong>  Sadly, the last four hours of the trip is a bus ride from Raton, NM to Denver &#8212; but it&#8217;s a direct route with only two stops. (Hey, we didn&#8217;t build the rail system&#8230; there some places they just don&#8217;t go.)</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Are one-wayers welcome?</strong> Absolutely. I&#8217;m going roundtrip, but one way is cool too. Take the train out to RubyConf, then fly home in style!

<p>At the last <a href="http://sdruby.com">sd.rb</a> meeting, I gave a talk on the Summer of Rails and my experience developing Graffletopia (my first SoR app).</p>
<p>Thanks to Chris Abad, my presentation is now online and is available as the first episode of the official sd.rb podcast.</p>
<p>I gotta say&#8230; it&#8217;s kinda weird seeing yourself in iTunes.</p>

<p>Since returning from RailsConf, I&#8217;ve been working like mad on my first Rails app and Summer of Rails project.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>So, today, I&#8217;m very happy to announce I&#8217;ve just launched Graffletopia, a website that makes it easy to share OmniGraffle stencil files. (For those who don&#8217;t know, OmniGraffle is essentially Visio for Mac&#8230; but way better, of course. And stencils are just clip art files that can be easily shared.)</p>
<p><a href="http://graffletopia.com"><img src="/images/blog/graffletopia.gif" width="560" height="417" alt="Graffletopia" ></a></p>
<p>Stencils are a cool part of OmniGraffle, but the <a href="http://omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/extras/">list on the Omnigroup website</a> always seemed a bit buried. Hopefully, by having a separate site for sharing stencils, it will be easier to find and share cool stencils.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Graffletopia will ever be a huge website, but I&#8217;m willing to bet many other Mac-based web designers will find it useful.</p>

<p>Today, I&#8217;m excited to be launching <a href="http://summerofrails.org">Summer of Rails</a>, a new website for the Rails community.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people, I&#8217;m pretty stoked about developing applications in Ruby in Rails. I&#8217;ve gotten the books, built a shopping cart, all that stuff. But I still haven&#8217;t launched my first Rails site. And I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;m not alone.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the <a href="http://summerofrails.org">Summer of Rails</a> challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn Rails</li>
<li>Make something useful</li>
<li>Badge it</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy, right? So let&#8217;s see how many Rails apps we can launch by the end of summer!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in Chicago for RailsConf. The conference doesn&#8217;t start until tomorrow, but the <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook">Rails Guidebook</a> and <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/schedule">hackfest</a> are happening for those who arrive early.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably be at the hackfest today&#8230; maybe I&#8217;ll see you there?

<p>I always surf <a href="http://cnn.com">CNN.com</a> reluctantly. It&#8217;s not a great website (even <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/03/26/cnn.com.homepage/">post-redesign</a>), but sometimes it can be useful.</p>
<p>So, check out yesterday&#8217;s &#8220;Top Stories&#8221; on the homepage:</p>
<p><img src="http://mokolabs.com/images/blog/cnn2.png" alt="CNN.com" width="560" height="264" /></p>
<p>A wife killing her therapist hubby, men leaving towns without husbands, two separate death plunges, a scary dog, a deer beating up a woman, a dead whale, and where Britney Spears might give birth next.</p>
<p>Definitely entertaining. But it&#8217;s not really news, is it?

<p>After a long hiatus, <a href="http://galacticaa.net">Galacticaa.net</a> is back. (For those who don&#8217;t know, Galacticaa is my part-time fan site for the new Battlestar Galactica show.)</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I went up to LA for the BSG Season 2 CD release party. Pretty cool event. Got to hear a live performance of the score, with Bear McCreary and many of the other musicians who work on the show. If you&#8217;re a fan of the show, read the <a href="http://galacticaa.net/2006/06/13/bsg-season-2-cd-release-party">full blog post</a>.</p>
<p>While BSG is off the air until October, I&#8217;ll be blogging about the show over the summer.

<p>Today, I&#8217;m launching a new version of moko.labs.</p>
<p>While the original website, launched in early 2000, wasn&#8217;t bad; it was sorely outdated.<br />
Six years later, I&#8217;ve changed and the web has changed, so moko.labs needed to evolve.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s new?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A brand new look-and-feel</li>
<li>A new blog — I&#8217;ve been blogging for years, but this is the first time I&#8217;ve gone solo</li>
<li>Full web-standards support, including XHTML, CSS, Atom 1.0, and Microformats</li>
<li><a href="/web/">Web</a> page with a list of my contributions to the web</li>
<li><a href="/photo/">Photo</a> page with sample photographs, FAQ, and recent photos</li>
<li><a href="/film/">Film</a> page explaining my interest in film and directing</li>
<li><a href="/about/">About</a> page with contact info and personal facts</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fresh content. Probably something new every few days.</li>
<li>Agility. Expect the content and design to change often.</li>
<li>Interesting things.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the new look</h2>
<p>For those who are curious, the header was inspired by a sunset I saw at 30,000 feet.</p>
<p><img src="http://mokolabs.com/images/about/sunset.gif" alt="Sunset" width="560" height="64" /></p>
<p>It was so stunning that I attempted to replicate what I saw while I was still in mid-air.<br />
When it was done, I couldn&#8217;t leave it alone and eventually I decided to use it for the new moko.labs.</p>
<p>Rounded corners, gradients, and big type were added to round out the look. (Yeah, they&#8217;re pretty standard for Web 2.0 these days, but there&#8217;s a reason for that&hellip; they&#8217;re cool.)</p>
<p>But the biggest part of this design is simplicity. I&#8217;m hoping I really <em>can</em> do more with less.
